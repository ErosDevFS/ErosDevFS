##Hey y'all
##I'm Julian Sedano 🥷
###Full Stack Web Developer in progress⏳

###Short story about me:
####“I started programming seriously when I was 15. I took a couple of important courses for my career. One of them was Master in Python: Python 3 (Django and Flask). I remember how much I enjoyed this course because Python was so easy to understand and write; it gave me a real sense of freedom when coding.
