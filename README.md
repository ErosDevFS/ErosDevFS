### Short story about me:
#### I started programming seriously when I was 15. I took a couple of important courses for my career. One of them was Master in Python: Python 3 (Django and Flask). I remember how much I enjoyed this course because Python was so easy to understand and write; it gave me a real sense of freedom when coding.

### Skills: 
-HTML & CSS
-Bootstrap
-JavaScritp
-React JS
-Python 3(Djando, Flask & Tkinter)
-PHP (Building Web Aplications
